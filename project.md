A project aimed at representing and analyzing data related to the United States Supreme Court using Neo4j graph database technology. This repository contains the API and associated scripts to interact with the Neo4j database for querying and managing Supreme Court data.

## Features

- Graph-based representation of Supreme Court data
- API layer for interacting with Neo4j database
- Structured to support complex queries and relationship mappings

## Tech Stack

- Neo4j (Graph Database)
- Likely Python or JavaScript for API (assumed based on common Neo4j API usage)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Neo4j installed and running
- Appropriate programming language runtime (e.g., Python 3.x or Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/supreme_court_graph_neo4j.git
cd supreme_court_graph_neo4j
```

2. Navigate to the `neo4jAPI` directory and install dependencies (assumed Node.js or Python):

- If Node.js:

```bash
cd neo4jAPI
npm install
```

- If Python:

```bash
cd neo4jAPI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running

- Start the Neo4j database server.
- Run the API server (assumed):

```bash
# Node.js example
npm start

# or Python example
python app.py
```

## Project Structure

```
supreme_court_graph_neo4j/
└── neo4jAPI/          # API and scripts for interacting with Neo4j
```

- `neo4jAPI/` contains the core codebase for querying and managing the graph database.

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Add detailed documentation and example queries
- Expand dataset coverage and enrich relationships
- Implement user authentication and access control for API
- Develop frontend visualization tools for graph data
- Optimize query performance and indexing
